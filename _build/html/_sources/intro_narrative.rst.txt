Project Highlights and Impacts
**********************************

Damage to the built infrastructure during hurricanes shows thepotential risk to critical coastal bridges. This risk could be higher in thefuture hurricanes because of climate change effects and sea-level riseand their impact on coastal zones. The goal of this research project isto provide DelDOT and other State agencies with the ability to simulatevarious combined storm scenarios for the purpose of understanding1what assets are vulnerable to damage. Our research team proposes anine-step Adaptation Planning Framework (APF) to help DelDOT betterchoose cost-effective options to improve the network’s resiliency. Inspecific, this framework will consider what parameters should be usedin designing roads and bridges, how to manage travel during and afterdisasters, and the cost of maintaining transportation assets. The development of the Adaptation Policy Framework is intended to provide DelDOT with the rapidly evolving process of adaptation policy-making for reducing vulnerability to longer-term climate change. A user’s guidebook will be developed to provide concise guidance on how to carry out an adaption project and develop efficient adaptation strategies using the proposed nine-step Adaptation Planning Framework. #. In recent decades, the coastal Mid-Atlantic States have been affected by extreme hurricane storms that cause severe flooding, significant damage to transportation facilities, and massive beach erosion. #. The value and broader significance of this project are the development of a computational framework for the prediction of vulnerability of transportation system including roads, airport, harbors, and other transportation facilities due to extreme hurricane storm surges and the development of a set of guidelines for reducing these vulnerabilities. #. The outcome of this research will be a set of better-integrated and more sustainable tools to determine sustainable solutions for the most vulnerable transportation infrastructure given the physical and environmental dynamic of storm surges and sea level rise in coastal areas. #. This research will provide key insights into the question of what policies will lead to more effective evacuation plans and more resilient transportation infrastructure design. #. Successful application and implementation of outcomes of this project will help enhance the adaptability and resilience of transportation system with respect to combined storm surge and sea-level rise impact.
